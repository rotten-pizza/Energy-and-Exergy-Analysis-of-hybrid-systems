# Energy-and-Exergy-Analysis-of-hybrid-systems
This repository contains the B.Tech project on the "Energy and Exergy Analysis of Hybrid Refrigeration Systems". It focuses on improving energy efficiency by utilizing waste heat from a Transcritical CO₂ Refrigeration System (TCRS) to power various H₂O-LiBr Vapor Absorption Refrigeration Systems (VARS). The project includes a thermodynamic analysis and Python-based simulations to compare the Coefficient of Performance (COP) and exergetic efficiency of TCRS when combined with single-effect, series flow double-effect, and parallel flow double-effect VARS configurations. The final report and simulation code are included.
